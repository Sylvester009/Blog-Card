## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to make my webpage responsive and gained a better grasp on how to manipulate the width and height of my webpage.

```css
.card {
  background-color: var(--White);
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 2px solid var(--Black);
  border-radius: 30px;
  width: auto;
  max-width: 350px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  box-shadow: var(--Black) 10px 10px;
}
```

### Continued development

Right now, I intend to embark on journey where I will learn how to practically put to use all the knowledge I gained via the building of websites and this is the first of many.
